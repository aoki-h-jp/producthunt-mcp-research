# producthunt-mcp-research

`producthunt-mcp-research` is a powerful MCP-based search platform for Product Hunt data with AI-powered natural language queries. Built with TypeScript and following modern software architecture principles, it provides a robust foundation for semantic search and data exploration through AI assistants.

## What is producthunt-mcp-research?

`producthunt-mcp-research` is a monorepo-based application that consists of several specialized modules:

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "AI Integration"
        M[MCP Server<br/>mcp-server-qdrant]
        AI[AI Assistant]
    end

    subgraph "Storage Layer"
        L[Qdrant<br/>Local Vector DB]
    end

    subgraph "Core Modules"
        F[Fetcher<br/>Product Hunt API]
        R[Repository<br/>Embedding + Qdrant]
        O[Orchestrator<br/>CLI + Coordination]
        S[Shared<br/>Types + Utils]
    end

    subgraph "Data Sources"
        PH[Product Hunt API<br/>GraphQL]
    end

- **Fetcher**: Handles data retrieval from Product Hunt API using GraphQL
- **Repository**: Manages data persistence with Qdrant and generates embeddings using Transformers.js
- **Orchestrator**: Provides CLI interface and coordinates the data ingestion workflow
- **Shared**: Contains common utilities, types, and logging used across modules

## Key Benefits

### Local-First Design
Designed for local personal use only, **enabling you to set up a powerful analysis and search platform for free on your environment** with Qdrant's efficient vector search capabilities.

### AI-Powered Search
Integrates with MCP (Model Context Protocol) to enable natural language queries through AI assistants, making data exploration accessible to everyone.

## Use Cases

`producthunt-mcp-research` is perfect for:

- **Business Opportunity Discovery**: Using AI-powered search to identify emerging trends and market needs
- **Product Research**: Gathering insights about product launches and user engagement through natural language queries
- **Competitive Intelligence**: Monitoring competitor products and their performance with semantic search
- **Market Analysis**: Understanding user pain points and willingness-to-pay signals through comment analysis

## Important Note

This tool is designed for **local personal use only**. Product Hunt's API terms of service prohibit commercial use, and this repository is provided as open source software for individual analysis and research purposes.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- pnpm (v8 or higher)
- Product Hunt API token

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aoki-h-jp/producthunt-mcp-research.git
   cd producthunt-mcp-research
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit `.env` and **replace** `your_developer_token_here` with your actual Product Hunt API token:
   ```bash
   PH_API_TOKEN=your_actual_token_here
   ```
   
   üìñ **Get your API token from**: https://api.producthunt.com/v2/oauth/applications
   
   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Make sure to use your actual API token, not the placeholder value!

4. **Build the project**
   ```bash
   pnpm run build
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: The build will fail if the `.env` file is not properly configured. Make sure you have set your `PH_API_TOKEN` before running the build command.
